Dear <ins>ReadMe</ins>, 

&emsp; &emsp; ==It’s 2022==; things should just work, right?  It seems like I’ve been saying that since I graduated college in 2012, though.  My name is [Michael Javier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-javier-35097a48/), and I'm a growing **full-stack developer** and have long been intrigued about **text editors** and **Markdown**.

&emsp; &emsp; Something that I’ve noticed repeatedly over the years while working in the tech industry, is that not only does software **NOT** work like it should, but documentation on how to make it work is either *poor quality*, *out-of-date*, or *non-existent*.  This goes for everything from business requirements, to hiring procedures.  From technical documents, to support tickets. API configuration to training docs.  More often than not, what little documentation there is out there is *dull* or *difficult to skim*.

&emsp; &emsp; When I stumbled upon <ins>ReadMe</ins>'s listing on LinkedIn for a [Full Stack Engineer Markdown Specialist](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3159503882/?refId=fe55bf7d-373d-4217-a960-24fd18b080c1), there was something in my mind that just clicked.  The job listing itself was **fresh** and **enticing**, things that are very hard to come by when perusing jobs on LinkedIn.  And then when I actually saw <ins>ReadMe</ins>'s API documentation, I was blown away.  That's when I realized that <ins>ReadMe</ins> gets it.  The documentation that <ins>ReadMe</ins> has so far is **pretty**, **intuitive**, and **awesome**.

&emsp; &emsp; I wish that I'd had API documentation like <ins>ReadMe</ins>'s  for as long as I've been working in the tech sector.  I've used Swagger API documentation before.  For lack of a better term, it was just awful.  Sure, it was easy to set up and to add new API entries to it.  But, it was *ugly to look at*, *clunky to use*, and *generally treated as an afterthought*.  The way that <ins>ReadMe</ins> approaches documentation, is how I wish documentation looked everywhere.

&emsp; &emsp; Now, I'm hooked and I want to help how ever I can to make <ins>ReadMe</ins> even better, so <ins>ReadMe</ins> ends up everywhere.  From the [Full Stack Engineer Markdown Specialist](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3159503882/?refId=fe55bf7d-373d-4217-a960-24fd18b080c1) description, it sounds like **Kelly is a React wizard**.  However, all of my web development experience is in **Angular**.

I look forward to speaking with **Kelly** or **Rafe** or whoever at <ins>ReadMe</ins> about _JavaScript_, _documentation_, or maybe _nerd-stuff_.

&emsp; &emsp;Thanks for listening to me **rant** about documentation and **gush** about <ins>ReadMe</ins> for a while.

&emsp; &emsp; Sincerly,
